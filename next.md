### Next Steps

- Build and push three images:
  - patch-agent-api
  - streamlit-ui
  - kb-service
- Deploy all three in OpenShift using Deployment, Service, Route.
- Create Secret for AAP credentials.
- Create PVC for reports.
- Test Streamlit UI → run patch jobs → download reports.

Do you want me to now provide:
✔ Full OpenShift manifests for all 3 components (API, UI, KB)?
✔ Dockerfiles for all 3?
✔ Sample KB JSON with common Linux patching errors?
✔ Celery worker design for async job monitoring (optional for now)?
