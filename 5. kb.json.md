{
  "errors": [
    {
      "error_pattern": "Could not resolve host",
      "solution": "Check DNS configuration. Ensure /etc/resolv.conf has correct nameservers and the host can reach the DNS server."
    },
    {
      "error_pattern": "No space left on device",
      "solution": "Clean up old kernels and temporary files. Run 'dnf remove old-kernel' or clear /var/cache/dnf and /tmp."
    },
    {
      "error_pattern": "Cannot find a valid baseurl",
      "solution": "Verify the repository configuration in /etc/yum.repos.d/. Ensure the baseurl is correct and the system has internet access."
    },
    {
      "error_pattern": "Error locking transaction",
      "solution": "Another package manager process may be running. Kill the existing 'dnf' or 'yum' process and retry."
    },
    {
      "error_pattern": "Kernel panic after reboot",
      "solution": "Boot into the previous kernel from GRUB and investigate recent changes. Check hardware drivers and remove incompatible modules."
    },
    {
      "error_pattern": "Failed to download metadata for repo",
      "solution": "Run 'dnf clean all' and retry. Ensure the repo server is reachable and certificates are valid."
    },
    {
      "error_pattern": "Package conflict detected",
      "solution": "Use 'dnf swap' or '--allowerasing' to resolve conflicts. Check for EPEL or third-party repo incompatibilities."
    }
  ]
}

How this works:
- Each object has:
  - error_pattern → a regex-friendly text to match error output from failed playbooks.
  - solution → a simple remediation step.
---
Where to store:
- This file will be used by the Knowledge Base microservice (FastAPI).
- The service will load kb.json and provide an endpoint like /kb/search?error=<message> that returns a solution if found.

---
next:
- Do you want me to write the KB microservice code to search this file for matches and return the best solution?
- Do you want me to now write OpenShift Deployment + Service + Route YAML specifically for this KB microservice (optimized for your architecture with environment configs)? Or should I move on to API & UI services manifests next?
- Or should I extend this KB.json with 20+ more real-world patching errors for production-level robustness?
