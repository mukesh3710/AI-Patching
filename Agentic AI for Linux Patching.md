---
### Brief Summary of the Idea:
- The proposed idea is an AI-powered chatbot (Agentic AI) designed to automate pre-checks, patching, reboot, and post-checks on Linux servers during maintenance activities. The chatbot will take user requests, validate them, execute automated Ansible playbooks for pre/post-validation, patching, and reboot, and provide real-time feedback to users. The system will leverage: Ansible Automation Platform/AWX/Ansible Playbook for execution, Celery for asynchronous job handling, A Knowledge Base (KB) integrated with AI to suggest solutions, troubleshoot errors, and provide recommendations during or after patching, An easy-to-use web interface deployed on OpenShift/Kubernetes for scalability.

### Challenge/Business Opportunity & Scalability:
- Enterprise environments with thousands of Linux servers face significant operational overhead during change windows. Manual patching and checks are prone to errors, take significant time, and increase downtime risks. Implementing an AI-powered chatbot to automate these tasks enhances operational efficiency, minimizes downtime, and ensures regulatory compliance. This solution is highly scalable, supporting global hybrid infrastructures for enterprises, Managed Service Providers (MSPs), and cloud environments alike.
